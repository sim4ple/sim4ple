I received a call at the last minute to represent a company because nobody wanted to go on stage at the conference.   Long story short, I ended up committing $50 million dollars  to the SDG Goals to fight sex trafficking, modern slavery and poverty.

Launched Sim4ple & Mryjne.me / Concept Development to Spark,  A Self-Sustaining Economic Ecosystem - An Experiment on Modern Capitalism 
Influence by 90% of the World Population Holding ONLY 3% of the Wealth.
‚ÄúOut of Sight Out of Mind‚Äù aka $osom
Right now, over 1 Billion People in the world are living on less than a $1 dollar day and the world‚Äôs poorest families are more likely to have access to a cell phone than a toilet or clean water, according to a report by the World Bank.  The sim4ple project is a small step to impact poverty directly by indirect actions of the ecosystem.  Sim4ple will allow anybody in the world to EARN just $1 dollar a day with a smartphone regardless of their location or background. Think about this for a moment. You‚Äôd be earning the amount you need to LIVE.
We do not want to replace or fix the existing financial system.  Just an alternative for peoPLE that wants a platform that is beneficial to everyone involved and wish to share the success with the community.   Sim4ple project is about CHOICE.   We are creating a decentralized economic infrastructure that ANYONE can be a part of because I feel there is a clear gap in the cryptocurrency market for a coin/token that anyone can use or access.  I didn‚Äôt want a coin/token that was only available to rich investors and computer geniuses or required a lot of time to set up or maintain.
Did you know when Satoshi released Bitcoin; he intended it to be mined on computer CPUs and Bitcoin mining could be performed on a normal desktop computer?  Unfortunately he apparently failed to anticipate the centralization in Bitcoin mining. Today, 90% of cryptocurrency is mined by server farms and billionaires. The concentration of miners is even more profound; 10% of miners control 90% of the Bitcoin & Ethereum mining capacity.
Imagine a mobile cryptocurrency you can mine with a mobile phone.  We believe that access to the blockchain should not be a privilege of a few. Our priority is to provide all users with the ability to benefit from the blockchain revolution, and with no prior knowledge in crypto-economics is needed.  We aim to remove barriers to entry to allow anybody in the world with a cell phone to earn $1 dollar a day through mining, which is the backbone of any blockchain network.  Miners basically are the people whose responsibility is to process, verify, and record the transactions on the blockchain. By providing this service, the miners of our blockchain receive part of transaction fees paid by users.
Mryjne.me 
Social Club Incubator Accelerator
An Experiment on Modern Capitalism  
Self-Sustaining Social Capital Eco-System 
Imagine Cambridge Innovation Center had a threesome with The SoHo House, Burning Man and had a love child.  Mryjne.me is a member‚Äôs only social club with benefits of an Incubator and Accelerator with no application process, no fees, no interview, and you can't buy your way in.  Designed to evolve with ecosystem with 3 sim4ple fundamental rules:
Leave the EGO at the door
Don‚Äôt ask for FAVORS
‚ÄúNo Question is a Dumb Question‚Äù 
Members participate at their own pace it the ecosystem which is a pool of collective knowledge of like-minded individuals to help themselves grow and positively impact the community or not.  More importantly, the platform allows members to experiment with business strategies in a controlled environment and allows them to engage with the ecosystem to act upon live information.  The ecosystem mirrors the success of group interactions, with members connected and providing resources and expertise to other group members, who act as experts and mentors. We believe the results of interactions between different members are something, which no one of those members could produce by themselves.    
S4ME, aka $s4me
We decided to bootstrap S4ME. Just in case you‚Äôre not familiar with the term bootstrapping: It‚Äôs a startup terminology to start something using nothing but your own funds. It can also refer to new businesses that have chosen not to seek outside funding.  
Vision
In following Ethereums lead, we do not want to bring in a new paradigm in economic interaction, without any egos, caveats or restrictions nor do we want to replace or fix the existing system.  We hope to sim4plify the adoption of blockchain to the 90% of the world with our platform; that allows anyone to integrate blockchain solutions to any endeavor (personal or business).  We aim to provide the power for anyone to design, build, deploy, and maintain a blockchain project within our ecosystem and hopefully out.
Mission
S4ME is not aiming for short term success, but instead using a sustainable strategy, of bringing innovation by supporting a network of economic interaction that can integrate to our ecosystem using ledger any kind (private or public ledger).  All this means that it will be possible to seamlessly integrate new resources in the network, provided they adhere to our governance.  This will allow the S4ME ecosystem to expand over time while keeping its protocol intact.
We are here to invite you join our Dynamic 3-Phase Project built on the Ethereum blockchain designed to bring a revolutionary economic interaction which hopefully won‚Äôt end.
